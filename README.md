You can find here a simple installation manual in German. The steps are rather simple:
1. Make a database backup and backup of your shop files.
2. Execute the SQL file from db.sql.
3. Copy all files from the folder files to your shop directory.
4. Apply the changes from folder changes to your shop code. See the German manual for details about this.
